# Rust (basic)

Going through Rust language and writing modular utils.

## Some Rust Notes

- Variables hold primitive data or references to data
- Variables are immutable by default - you can init a var to be mutable -> `let mut x = 'hello world';`
- While variables are immutable by default there is a `const` keyword. It requires that you specify the type when initialising it
